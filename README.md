- Valid string input  
- Invalid string input (Exception case)  

---

## Example Output

## Technologies Used

- Java  
- JUnit 5

# UC2 - Equality Comparison

This use case implements equality comparison for:

- Feet
- Inches

Objects are created using:
Feet.fromString("1.0");
Inches.fromString("1.0");

Invalid numeric input throws a custom exception.

## Equality Rules
- Same value → true
- Different value → false
- Null → false
- Same reference → true
- Different class → false

## Tech
Java, JUnit 5

# UC3 – Generic Quantity Class (DRY Principle)

## Description
UC3 refactors separate `Feet` and `Inches` classes into a single generic `Quantity` class using a `LengthUnit` enum.  
This eliminates code duplication and follows the DRY principle.

## How It Works
- User enters value and unit (feet/inch).
- Values are converted to a common base unit (feet).
- Equality is checked using value-based comparison.

## Key Concepts
- DRY Principle
- Enum Usage
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Proper equals() contract
- Cross-unit comparison (1 foot = 12 inches)

# Quantity Measurement – UC4

## Supported Units

* Feet
* Inch
* Yard
* Centimeter

## Features

* Takes input from user
* Converts units internally
* Checks if two values are equal
* Supports cross-unit comparison

## Example

1 Feet = 12 Inch
3 Feet = 1 Yard
2.54 Centimeter = 1 Inch

# UC5 – Unit-to-Unit Conversion

UC5 adds direct conversion between length units using a common base unit.

## Supported Units

FEET, INCHES, YARDS, CENTIMETERS

## Features

* Static `convert(value, source, target)` method
* Instance `convertTo()` method
* Base unit normalization
* Input validation (null, NaN, infinite)
* Immutable value object

## Formula

```
result = value × (source.factor / target.factor)
```

## Example

* 1 FEET → INCHES = 12
* 3 YARDS → FEET = 9
* 36 INCHES → YARDS = 1

# UC6 – Addition of Two Length Units

UC6 extends UC5 by adding support for **addition of two length measurements** (same category).

## Supported Units

FEET, INCHES, YARDS, CENTIMETERS

## Features

* Add two `Length` objects
* Automatic unit conversion before addition
* Result returned in unit of first operand
* Uses base unit normalization (FEET)
* Immutable design (returns new object)
* Input validation for null, NaN, infinite values

## Logic

1. Convert both lengths to base unit (FEET)
2. Add values
3. Convert sum back to first operand’s unit
4. Return new `Length` object

## Example

* 1 FEET + 2 FEET = 3 FEET
* 1 FEET + 12 INCHES = 2 FEET
* 12 INCHES + 1 FEET = 24 INCHES
* 1 YARD + 3 FEET = 2 YARDS

# Quantity Measurement – UC7

## Description

This project performs **length addition and unit conversion** using OOP principles in Java.

## Supported Units

* FEET
* INCHES
* YARDS
* CENTIMETERS

## Features

* Add two quantities
* Automatic unit conversion
* Result in chosen target unit
* Equality comparison using base unit (FEET)
* Immutable design
* Input validation

## Example

```
1 FEET + 12 INCHES

Output:
2.0 feet
24.0 inches
0.6666666666666666 yards
```

## Design

* Base unit: FEET
* Uses conversion factors
* EPSILON-based equality comparison

# UC8 – Standalone LengthUnit Refactoring

## Description

UC8 refactors the design by extracting `LengthUnit` into a standalone enum and assigning it full responsibility for unit conversions.

## Key Improvements

* `LengthUnit` handles all conversion logic
* `Quantity` handles comparison and arithmetic
* Follows Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* Removes circular dependency risk
* Improves scalability for future units (Weight, Volume, etc.)
* Fully backward compatible with UC1–UC7

## Supported Units

* FEET
* INCHES
* YARDS
* CENTIMETERS

## Example Output

```
Convert 1 FEET to INCHES:
12.0 inches

Add 1 FEET + 12 INCHES (in FEET):
2.0 feet

Add 1 FEET + 12 INCHES (in YARDS):
0.6666666666666666 yards

36 INCHES equals 1 YARDS?
true
```

## Architecture

* Base Unit: FEET
* Conversion delegated to `LengthUnit`
* Equality uses epsilon comparison
* Immutable design

# UC9 – Weight Measurement

## Description
UC9 extends the Quantity Measurement Application to support **Weight Measurements** alongside Length.

Supported Units:
- **KILOGRAM (kg)** – Base unit
- **GRAM (g)** – 1 g = 0.001 kg
- **POUND (lb)** – 1 lb = 0.453592 kg

## Features
- Equality comparison (cross-unit supported)
- Unit conversion
- Addition (implicit & explicit target unit)
- Immutable design
- Type-safe (Weight ≠ Length)
- Uses epsilon (1e-6) for floating-point precision

## Conclusion
UC9 validates scalable architecture by supporting multiple measurement categories without affecting existing length functionality.
